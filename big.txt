We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, 
in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, 
solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, 
and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, 
and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; 
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish 
Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of 
this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our 
Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet 
sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor; a long habit 
of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of 
being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of 
custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than 
reason.

As a long and violent abuse of power, is generally the Means of calling 
the right of it in question (and in Matters too which might never have 
been thought of, had not the Sufferers been aggravated into the inquiry) 
and as the King of England hath undertaken in his own Right, to support 
the Parliament in what he calls Theirs, and as the good people of this 
country are grievously oppressed by the combination, they have an undoubted 
privilege to inquire into the pretensions of both, and equally to reject the 
usurpation of either.
